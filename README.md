**Theophilus Malatji**

Aspiring DevOps Engineer | Backend Software Development & Cloud Engineering Enthusiast
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Theophilus Malatji, a passionate and driven individual currently immersed in the exciting worlds of backend software development and cloud engineering. My goal is to become a proficient DevOps Engineer, bridging the gap between development and operations to build and deploy robust, scalable, and efficient software solutions.

**About Me**

I'm currently focused on mastering the principles and practices that underpin modern software delivery. This includes:

Backend Development: Building the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power applications. I'm exploring various programming languages, frameworks, and architectural patterns.

Cloud Engineering: Leveraging cloud platforms to design, implement, and manage highly available and fault-tolerant systems. I'm gaining hands-on experience with cloud services, infrastructure as code, and cloud-native technologies.

DevOps Principles: Learning about continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), automation, monitoring, and site reliability engineering (SRE) to streamline development workflows and enhance system performance.

**My Journey & Learning Focus**

My journey is all about hands-on learning and practical application. I'm actively working on projects that allow me to:

Develop backend services using languages like Python, Java, or Node.js.

Experiment with different database technologies (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).

Deploy applications to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

Set up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

Explore containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.

Implement monitoring and logging solutions to ensure application health and performance.
